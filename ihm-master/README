IHM = I Hate Mondays
Uses GARFIELD++ to calculate coefficients needed for TexAtSim/TeBATSim
To set up GARFIELD - add the following to your system paths:

export GARFIELD_HOME = /usr/local/garfield_v3.0

Compile with makefile and execute with ./IHM
Then input either single or double gas
Then name of gas (and ratio and second gas/ratio)
Enter pressure in Torr
Then enter FC voltage
The program will then give you drift velocity and position/time resolution
